Process:

    Unforenutaly, I had a real difficult time trying to be able to understand the subject & make my code work. I did research several articles, but they all had different ways of attempting the homwework that we never went over - I wanted to keep it within our skillset. Other struggles I had was with my time management with the long hours I was expected to work at my current job. I eventually went back to it to go over it after a better understanding the next week and have a good feel for this now.
