# Psychic-Game

Description:

     Make a game where it's about you vs the computer in a game of guesses. Start off with 10 guesses and select any letter
     from the alphabet and see if you guessed the computer's letter correctly. This will involve several functions, loops
     and conditional statements to be able to pull this off.

Tech used:
    +HTML
    +Javascript
        -Loops
        -Variables
        -Functions
        -Conditionals

Process:

    Unforenutaly, I had a real difficult time trying to be able to understand the subject & make my code work. I did research several articles, but they all had different ways of attempting the homwework that we never went over - I wanted to keep it within our skillset. Other struggles I had was with my time management with the long hours I was expected to work at my current job. 
    There may be a high chance that I put in my 2 weeks at work this month if this continues on because I really do want to pass this class and place this above anything else. After doing the 
    best I could to get the homework done, I realized I just wasn't getting it and signed up for some tutorials and went over all the links that were set thorugh Slack. I'm happy to say that I finally have a better grasp and understanding of Javascript than I ever did; I just wish it could've been sooner.
